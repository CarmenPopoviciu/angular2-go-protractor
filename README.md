# Angular 2 Go !

Simple starter example that gets you going with Angular 2 in minutes.

## Pre-Requisites

1. Must install pre-requisites

	```bash
	npm install -g typescript live-server
	```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

1. Run `npm install`

1. Run the TypeScript compiler and watch for changes `npm run tsc`

1. Open 2nd terminal and launch the app in the browser `npm start`

## Notes

This sample intentionally uses precise versions of Angular 2 and SystemJS so new versions do not break it. I will update these as Angular 2 moves out of Alpha.

This uses the Path Routing Strategy (HTML5 Mode in Angular 1). This is ideal, however since this demo strives for a simple server using live-server, if you refresh the browser when on a deep link )a named route), you will get a 404. Simply go back to the root /.
